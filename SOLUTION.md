# CSV Processing Application - Owner Occupied Filtering Fix

## Issue Description

The CSV processing application was showing incorrect filtering results:
- The "Owner Occupied" filter was showing non-owner occupied properties instead of owner-occupied ones
- This was causing confusion when using the different list options

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Misinterpretation of "Owner Occupied" Field Values:**
   - The application was only looking for specific "Y" values to identify owner-occupied properties
   - Many CSV files might leave the field empty or use different values to indicate occupancy status
   - The empty values were causing confusion in property classification

2. **Incomplete Filtering Logic:**
   - The "not owner occupied" check was too simplistic (simple negation of the owner-occupied check)
   - There was no fallback logic for when explicit "Y" or "N" values weren't found

## Solution Implemented

We've made several improvements to address these issues:

1. **Enhanced Filtering Logic:**
   - Added extensive debug logging to show the actual values in the Owner Occupied column
   - Implemented fallback strategies when "Y" or "N" values aren't found:
     - For "Owner Occupied" filter: If no "Y" values are found, look for non-empty owner name fields
     - For "Renter" filter: If no "N" values are found, use empty Owner Occupied fields
     - For "Investor" filter: If no "N" values are found, use empty Owner Occupied fields where owner names exist

2. **Improved User Interface:**
   - Updated filter descriptions to better explain what each option does
   - Enhanced the debug logging to provide more visibility into the filtering process
   - Added clear warnings about how empty values are handled

3. **Better Documentation and Testing:**
   - Created a test data file with explicit "Y" and "N" values for validation
   - Added comprehensive logging to show what's happening during filtering
   - Documented the fallback strategies in both the code and the UI

## How to Test

1. Go to http://localhost:3005/test.html
2. Upload either your CSV file or our test-data-example.csv
3. Try each filter option:
   - All Records: Shows all properties without filtering
   - Owner Occupied: Shows only properties marked with "Y" (or with owner names, if no Y/N values found)
   - Renter: Shows properties marked with "N" (or empty fields) and replaces names with "Current Renter"
   - Investor: Shows properties marked with "N" (or empty fields with owner data)
4. Check the debug logs for detailed information about what's happening

## Expected Results

- **Owner Occupied Filter**: Should only show properties where the owner lives at the address
- **Renter Filter**: Should show properties where the owner does not live at the address, with "Current Renter" as the name
- **Investor Filter**: Should show properties where the owner does not live at the address, but with the actual owner name
